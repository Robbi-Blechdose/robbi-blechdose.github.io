      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve (probably) been watching way too much Knight Rider recently. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve started modifying my car. \
It&amp;rsquo;s by no means a KITT, or even a Trans Am. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s a Nissan Micra K12.
The first thing I did was add the famous scanner: \
The micra has a handy little space between the hood and the front bumper, perfect for a scanner. The problem is that that space is everything but big.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Robbi&amp;rdquo; is a game I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for a while now. It&amp;rsquo;s written in raw assembly for the GameBoy Color. Though it&amp;rsquo;s currently running on an emulator for easy development, it would run on real hardware as well.
Right now, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much in terms of content as I&amp;rsquo;m still creating the basic systems. However, a few basics are done: \
You can walk (or rather drive) around the map, which has a maximum size of 128x128 tiles.</description>

      <description>Car Gauge Unit: Graph Mode The small screen at the right-hand side of the unit allows me to enter some data whenever I fill up the tank of my car:
 The amount of fuel I put in (in litres) How much the fuel cost (in â‚¬ per litre) The total mileage of the car  With this, it calculates the gas mileage (in litres / 100km). However, I only had a total average as well as a &amp;ldquo;best ever&amp;rdquo; value.</description>

      <description>GB-J Compiler released! A compiler for a custom Java- and C-like language targeting the GameBoy  This is a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for quite a while, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue doing so in the future.
It started out as a school project for my A-levels: Write a compiler.
Choosing the target  The original idea was to target some fantasy computer to reduce the complexity of the project.</description>

      <description>Car Gauge Unit A project involving Arduino, 3D-Printing and my car This project requires a bit of background information: My car has two standard DIN slots.
The lower one is used up by the car radio, but the upper one just contained a laughably small second glovebox.
Then suddenly, I had an idea: My car is too old to calculate its gas mileage itself, so I might as well add in a device capable of doing that.</description>
