<h2 id="car-gauge-unit">Car Gauge Unit</h2>

<h1 id="a-project-involving-arduino-3d-printing-and-my-car">A project involving Arduino, 3D-Printing and my car</h1>

<p>This project requires a bit of background information: My car has two standard DIN slots.</p>

<p>The lower one is used up by the car radio, but the upper one just contained a laughably small second glovebox.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, I had an idea: My car is too old to calculate its gas mileage itself, so I might as well add in a device capable
of doing that. And what better place to put it than into the spot where that glovebox sat?</p>

<p><img src="../../images/2019-10-27-02-car-gauge-unit/IMG_20190918_163656632.jpg" alt="The small glovebox" /></p>

<p>Of course, an arduino with a display wouldn&rsquo;t take up all that space. So I came up with more things to add in.</p>

<p>The most visible one is the voltmeter which is directly connected to the 12v grid of the car. Since it&rsquo;s unregulated, I can
easily check the voltage from the battery when the engine is off, and the voltage of the alternator when the engine is running.</p>

<p>Since I needed a 5v power source for the arduino anyway, I bought a power brick that was way overkill (it supplies up to 3A!)
and added it in. Now I could power my Rasperry Pi Satnav (on top of the dashboard) from here too!
The satnav doesn&rsquo;t need to always be on, so I added a switch. Another switch joined it, this time for selecting which horn I&rsquo;d
like to use (I had a second one put in).
Finally, I added a temperature display too.</p>

<p>Building commenced:

<p>I 3D-printed the enclosure, only to find out it couldn&rsquo;t stand the heat of a car left in the sun. Also, it didn&rsquo;t fit very well.
The final version I ended up using was the 3rd print, for which I used PETG filament becausee of its better ability to withstand
high temperatures.</p>

<p>The electronics looked like this at first:

<p>There was of course a problem with this approach: Everything was a tangled mess of wires.
This led to some criticism and finally my decision to desolder everything and build a new board from scratch which had
all the parts on it.</p>

<p>I finalized the design to fit into the slot as well as possible, then added another gauge in (which I&rsquo;m planning on using
as an acceleration display). The red retro labels for the switches were made with a very old labelmaker I had laying around.
After all that work, here&rsquo;s the final result:</p>
