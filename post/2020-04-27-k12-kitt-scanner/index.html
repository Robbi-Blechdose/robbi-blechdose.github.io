    <p>I&rsquo;ve (probably) been watching way too much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Rider_(1982_TV_series)">Knight Rider</a> recently.
As a result, I&rsquo;ve started modifying my car.<br>
It&rsquo;s by no means a KITT, or even a Trans Am. In fact, it&rsquo;s a Nissan Micra K12.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was add the famous scanner:<br>
The micra has a handy little space between the hood and the front bumper, perfect for a scanner.
The problem is that that space is everything but big. That meant using the classic arrangement with reflectors and 8 lightbulbs was out of the question.</p>
<p>So I opted to go with much more modern technology: A waterproof WS2812 LED strip.<br>
The waterproofing is just a bit of silicon tubing around the LED strip, which has the added benefit of acting as a diffuser.<br>
As you can see, the LED strip fits neatly into the gap:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/2020-04-27-k12-kitt-scanner/IMG_20200501_110156586.jpg" alt="The LED strip"></p>
<p>The space here allows for a total of 17 LEDs, and since the WS2812 are RGB LEDs, I have a wide range of colors available too!<br>
From the LED strip itself, I routed cables to the inside of the car to an Arduino which takes care of the animations.</p>
<p>Because of this new flexibility, I wanted a bit more than an on/off switch.<br>
Luckily, there was some space in my car&rsquo;s dash for controls for electric wing mirrors (which mine doesn&rsquo;t have), so I designed a control panel to fit that space.
I modelled the outside shape off the blank insert, and added holes for a key switch and a rotary switch.<br>
This is what the final product looks like:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/2020-04-27-k12-kitt-scanner/IMG_20200501_110053490.jpg" alt="The control panel"></p>
<p>As you can see, there are a total of 8 modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>KITT (the one we all know and love)</li>
<li>KARR (the evil KITT, in yellow)</li>
<li>RGB (the classic animation of morphing one color into the next)</li>
<li>WARN FLASH (a flashing yellow light)</li>
<li>HEAD LIGHT (all LEDs light up white at maximum brightness)</li>
<li>ECO (green dots moving in from both sides towards the center)</li>
<li>SP. A (currently unused)</li>
<li>SP. B (currently unused)</li>
</ul>
<p>The button in the middle acts as a speed toggle, as almost all animations can switch between normal and fast mode.<br>
I&rsquo;ve also put the entire code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Robbi-Blechdose/K12_KITT_Scanner">https://github.com/Robbi-Blechdose/K12_KITT_Scanner</a></p>
<p>And finally, here&rsquo;s the scanner in action, in KITT mode:</p>
